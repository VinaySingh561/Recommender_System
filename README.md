Movie Recommendation System
This repository contains a movie recommendation system algorithm developed using Linear Regression. The algorithm leverages machine learning techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and movie attributes.

Overview
The recommendation system algorithm utilizes the following steps:

Loading User Ratings: The user ratings are loaded from an Excel file, which contains information about the ratings given by users for different movies. The ratings are processed and prepared for further analysis.

Determining Rated Movies: The algorithm identifies the movies for which the users have provided ratings. This step helps in understanding which movies have been evaluated by the users.

Linear Regression: The algorithm applies Linear Regression to predict ratings for unseen movies based on the available user ratings and movie attributes. This allows for the generation of accurate predictions and personalized recommendations.

Conversion to Binary Ratings: To simplify the recommendation process, the user ratings are converted into binary values, indicating whether a user has rated a movie or not. This step helps in building a more efficient and effective recommendation system.
